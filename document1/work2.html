									<h2>Intelligent Energy Monitoring and Management in Residential Grids</h2>
									<h3>Shitikantha Dash<br/>

									<p>Matching the energy demand and supply in real-time is an age-old and vital problem in the electric power system, essential for the grid's stable and reliable operation. Traditionally, the process is carried out by controlling the centralised generation, which is expensive or not realisable at times, leading to a wide-scale load shedding. Recently, participation of end-users as an active player has brought a significant paradigm shift in the power sector; this shift is realised in the developed regions due to the availability of advanced information and communication (ICT) infrastructure and energy-aware consumers. In the developing regions, like India, the infrastructure is not fully connected, penetration of rooftop-PV is insufficient, and the residences in these regions are subjected to a non-responsive inclining block rate (IBR) tariff system. Moreover, the market doesn't exist for distribution consumers. For the residences of such stringent and semi-regulated environments, this work has proposed an energy management (EM) model for both grid-connected and isolated-mode of operations to quickly and fairly manage the local supply-demand mismatch. The participation strategy suggested in the proposed EM model also enables the utility (via an aggregator) to exploit the flexibility offered by residential loads in peak demand hours on a contract basis. The work also highlights a fair incentive evaluation scheme and application of residential energy storage systems (ESS) in handling the uncertainties. Moreover, real-time load monitoring mechanisms, an indispensable element of energy management, are developed for both old-retrofitted and brand-new residences, considering socio-economic compulsions. Again, for a futuristic scenario, where the regulatory framework for time-varying pricing and distribution-level market is relaxed (as hinted in India's recent union budget), a transactive-energy (TE) model is also developed for the consumers' community to trade their appliances' flexibility via multiple aggregators to reduce the mismatch quickly and purchase power at a fairer price.</p>
									<p>The granular information on real-time energy consumption of residential appliances assists the decision-making units/operators in controlling individual loads instead of wide-scale shedding to handle the community's energy mismatch. The expensive part of this appliance-load monitoring (ALM) infrastructure is the sensing units (SU), and placing them for every individual appliance makes the ALM costlier. Further, since its placement and maintenance requires frequent physical intrusion inside the residence, this type of arrangement is called intrusive load monitoring (ILM) mechanism. To address the cost and intrusion problem, appliance-load disaggregation is studied, which estimates the energy consumption of individual appliances from the data read by smart meter placed outside the residences; also known as non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) technique. In this thesis, a two-stage NILM approach is proposed, where in stage-1, a standard deviation based automatic state detection algorithm (ASD) is developed, which results in the information about states and the transient spans of individual appliances. And a penalty-based enhanced integer programming (IP) based load disaggregation method is presented in stage-2. Various test results reveal that the proposed enhanced IP-based method is an effective and less complex solution to the load disaggregation problem. Despite the advancements in NILM techniques, the obtained accuracy can't outperform the 100% authenticity provided by ILM. Hence, to exploit the bests of both, in this work, an instrumentation approach-based semi-intrusive load monitoring (SILM) technique is proposed. In a newly built residence, installation of new equipment and additional in-home wiring can easily be done without much hassle to the residences; still, it can't be rid of cost issues and maintenance related intrusions. Hence in the proposed SILM, focus is on reducing the number of SU and monitoring the cluster of appliances through a specific time-division multiplexing technique. The performance evaluation shows drastic improvements in monitoring accuracy compared to NILM and a significant reduction in cost compared to the ILM mechanisms. However, since the NILM is a cheaper option than SILM, ALM deployment options can be chosen depending on the buildings' developmental status and socio-economic backgrounds of residents. </p>
									<p>Having obtained the near real-time energy consumption statuses of the appliances of residences in the community, the aggregator can now manage the loads to keep the monthly bill of residents under the desired limit or enforce the decision during unforeseen grid outages. This dynamism is achieved in the semi-regulated environment by changing the fictitious price, which is the basis of the proposed EM model crafted to exploit the block-based architecture of the IBR tariffs system. Here, given a cluster, i.e., a group of appliances that satisfies certain requirements, the proposed scheme is primarily driven by two layers of clustered priorities. The first layer of clusters comprises various services of the residences and governs it with shareable priorities, and the second layer of clusters binds the major power-consuming appliances under each substation and regulates it with dynamically changing priorities. ILP is used to solve the preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation (PROMETHEE)-II resulted multi-criteria decision problem to address both grid-connected and isolated modes of operations. It is also extended to a case to assist the utility in reducing the loads in peak demand in exchange for monetary benefits. The EM model is effective in providing a reliable power supply to the critical loads in all scenarios while keeping the price within the preference limit with minimum comfort-loss for end-users, even in the presence of a non-responsive IBR environment. Finally, the research work is extended to a transactive energy-based energy management strategy for the deregulated distribution environment. Here, active-hour appliances are traded in a decentralised pool-based market in parallel to an existing local energy market to solve the unforeseen load demand issues in a cost-effective manner. This work also addresses the price-preference privacy of the end-users and optimal power flow convergence issues. </p>
