									<h2>PhD, Electrical Engineering</h2>
									<h3>Indian Institute of Technology Ropar, Rupnagar, India</br>(Jan 2017 – Jul 2022) </h3>
									<h4><i>Thesis:</i> Intelligent Energy Monitoring and Management in Residential Grids</br>
										<i>Supervisors:</i> Dr. Ranjana Sodhi and Dr. Balwinder Sodhi</h4>

									<p>The primary objective of this thesis is to develop the energy management strategies to reduce the supply and demand imbalance in real-time owing to its vitality in stable and reliable operations of the power system. Traditionally, this task is accomplished by managing the supply. At times, when controlling generation is not feasible or not economically viable, blanket load-shedding of one or more large areas is often opted for. This leads to significant inconveniences for the end-users. To handle the problem effectively, this thesis proposes an appliance-wise energy consumption management strategy that considers the end-users' preferences and compensates for the inconveniences. To this end, two types of tariff environments are explored, viz. traditional inclining block rate tariffs and dynamic pricing tariffs. The former is suitable for the present developing region context, and the latter envisages the futuristic scenario. To enable this appliance-wise energy management, initially, two appliance-wise energy consumption monitoring strategies are developed in this thesis, viz., non-intrusive and semi-intrusive load monitoring for old and new residences. To ensure practicality, importance is given to cost, accuracy and end-users' conveniences, and the efficacy of these claims is validated from simulation and lab-scale testbed results.</p>

									<h2>M.Tech, Power System Engineering</h2>
									<h3>Center for Advanced Post Graduate Studies, BPUT, Rourkela, India</br>(Jul 2014 – Jul 2016) </h3>
									<h4><i>Thesis:</i> Serverless Cloud Computing Framework for Smart Grid Architecture</br>
										<i>Supervisors:</i> Dipak Kumar Dash</h4>
									
									<p>This work introduces an innovative approach to implement cloud computing to control the energy flow and protect the components in a smart grid. By utilising the serverless cloud computing framework, we aim to reduce the cost and complexities of existing models. Furthermore, a co-simulation architecture between MATLAB and Amazon Web Services (viz. S3 & Lambda) is designed to test the algorithms and estimate the cost and quality of services before the actual hardware implementation.</p>

									<h2>B.Tech, Electrical and Electronics Engineering</h2>
									<h3>Biju Patnaik University of Technology, Bhubaneswar, India</br>(Jul 2009 – Jul 2013) </h3>
									<h4><i>Project (Major):</i> Servo Motor-Controlled Voltage Stabilizer</br>
										<i>Project (Minor):</i> Relay-Controlled Voltage Stabilizer</br>
										<i>Supervisor:</i> Salil Kumar Malla</h4>

									<p>In this project, two stabilizer models were developed to regulate the voltage. Initially, a tap-based autotransformer was manufactured. In this model, taps are controlled by switching multiple relays. In the second model, the contact-based autotransformer is regulated using a servo motor.</p>
